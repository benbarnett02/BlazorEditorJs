# BlazorEditorJs

A simple editorjs implementation as a blazor component. 

All I ask for is a github star if you use this, thank you.

To see it's usage, please visit the `BlazorApp` project and inspect the files:
- BlazorApp\Pages\Index.razor
- BlazorApp\Pages\Index.razor.cs
- BlazorApp\README.md
